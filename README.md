# RAG Observability Platform — Technical Specification

## 1. PII / Sensitive Data Masking

**Requirement:** Detect and redact sensitive data before it reaches logs, telemetry, or dashboards.

| Component | Spec |
|---|---|
| Detection engine | Hybrid regex + NER microservice, called out-of-band from the main trace pipeline (gRPC/HTTP) |
| Entity types (v1) | SIN/SSN, credit card numbers, email, phone, physical address, name (NER), API keys/secrets |
| Interception point | OpenTelemetry Collector processor (span/attribute level) — scans configured attributes (e.g. `llm.prompt`, `llm.completion`, `retrieval.chunk`) |
| Redaction format | Category-labeled replacement (`[REDACTED:SIN]`, `[REDACTED:EMAIL]`) — not blanket `***`, so structure is preserved for debugging |
| Failure policy | Configurable: `fail-closed` (drop/block span if detection service unreachable) or `fail-open` (pass with warning flag) — default fail-closed |
| Scope | Applies to: prompts, completions, retrieved RAG chunks, tool-call arguments/results, logs, dashboard display |
| Output metadata | Every redaction event logs: entity type, policy version, model version, timestamp, span ID |

**Data model (redaction event):**
```json
{
  "span_id": "string",
  "tenant_id": "string",
  "entity_type": "SIN | CREDIT_CARD | EMAIL | NAME | ...",
  "field_scanned": "llm.prompt",
  "action": "redacted | flagged | failed",
  "policy_version": "string",
  "detector_version": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

## 2. Sensitive Prompt / Data-Collection Classification

**Requirement:** Platform must know *what categories* of sensitive data a monitored AI application is expected to collect, so admins can validate against actual behavior and map to applicable regulations.

| Component | Spec |
|---|---|
| App registration | Each monitored application declares an expected **data sensitivity profile** at onboarding (self-declared + auto-inferred from observed traffic) |
| Profile fields | `expected_pii_categories[]`, `data_subject_regions[]`, `purpose_of_collection`, `applicable_regulations[]` |
| Drift detection | Platform compares observed PII categories (from §1 detection) against declared profile; flags **undeclared PII collection** as a compliance alert |
| Regulation mapping | Static lookup table: PII category + user region → regulation (e.g. SIN + Canada → PIPEDA; EU resident + any PII → GDPR; health data → HIPAA) |
| Admin view | Dashboard surfaces: declared vs. actual sensitive data types, regulation exposure, and unresolved drift flags per application |

---

## 3. Access-Controlled Logs

**Requirement:** Centrally collect access events from monitored applications (sign-ins, privileged actions) and enforce/observe access controls, retention, and deletion attempts.

| Component | Spec |
|---|---|
| Ingestion | Applications emit access events (via SDK/agent or pulled from app's IdP — Okta/Azure AD/Cognito logs) |
| Event schema | `user_id`, `tenant_id`, `app_id`, `action` (login, privilege_grant, config_change, data_export...), `timestamp`, `source_ip`, `result` (success/fail) |
| Per-app drill-down | UI: click into an app → recent sign-ins, privileged actions, failed auth attempts |
| Retention metadata | Each app/tenant has a configured `log_retention_days`; platform tracks and enforces this centrally, independent of the source app |
| Deletion/purge monitoring | Platform detects and logs any delete/purge attempt against log data (own store + source app APIs where available); flags whether the **source application's own policy permits deletion** (`deletion_allowed: true/false`) |
| Alerting | Unauthorized or out-of-policy purge attempts trigger a high-severity alert (feeds into §5 audit trail alerting) |
| Access model | RBAC + SSO (SAML/OIDC); role scoping down to log-stream/dataset level, not just app level (per Parseable-style RBAC pattern) |

---

## 4. Data Retention Policies

**Requirement:** Track how long customer data resides in each agent and what regional retention rules apply.

| Component | Spec |
|---|---|
| Retention registry | Per-app config: `data_retention_period`, `data_categories_retained[]`, `storage_location(s)` |
| Region-awareness | Per-app field: `user_regions_served[]` → auto-maps to required regulation set (GDPR/EU, PIPEDA/Canada, CCPA/California, etc.) |
| Compliance check | Platform flags mismatch: e.g., app serves EU users but retention period exceeds GDPR-permitted storage limitation, or no documented lawful basis |
| Enforcement hook | Scheduled job cross-checks actual data age in app stores (where API access exists) vs. declared retention; alerts on overage |
| Dashboard | Retention status per app: compliant / at-risk / violation, with regulation citation |

---

## 5. Audit Trails

**Requirement:** Central store for each application's audit trail output; auto-alert admins + the app's builder on high/critical severity events.

| Component | Spec |
|---|---|
| Ingestion | Apps push structured audit records (or platform polls/subscribes) into a normalized `audit_events` table |
| Schema | `tenant_id`, `app_id`, `event_type`, `severity` (info/warn/high/critical), `actor`, `details`, `timestamp`, `policy_version` |
| Storage | Immutable, append-only (write-once) store; no update/delete permitted except via governed retention expiry job |
| Alert routing | On `severity IN (high, critical)`: notify (a) platform/AI administrator and (b) the registered owner/builder of that specific application — via configured channel (email, Slack, or an AI agent that triages and drafts an incident summary) |
| Alert payload | Includes: triggering event, affected app, affected tenant, suggested next action, link to full trace |

---

## 6. Secure Telemetry

**Requirement:** All telemetry (logs, prompts, responses, metrics, audit events, alerts) transmitted and stored securely, with sensitive data masked pre-transmission.

| Component | Spec |
|---|---|
| Transport | TLS 1.2+ for all telemetry in transit (OTLP/gRPC or HTTPS) |
| At-rest encryption | AES-256 (or provider-managed KMS) for stored logs/traces/audit data |
| Pre-transmission masking | Redaction (§1) executes **before** data leaves the source app's collector/agent — nothing unmasked crosses the network boundary |
| Key management | Vault-backed key management (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault); no hardcoded secrets in collector config |
| Integrity | Signed/hashed telemetry batches to detect tampering in transit |

---

## 7. Tenant Isolation

**Requirement:** Prevent cross-tenant data access; track inbound/outbound data exchange between monitored applications.

| Component | Spec |
|---|---|
| Tenant tagging | Every log, trace, alert, and audit record carries a mandatory `tenant_id` at ingestion — enforced at the schema/API level, not optional |
| Access enforcement | Query/API layer filters all reads by `tenant_id` matching the requester's assigned tenant(s); platform-level admin role can cross tenants only per explicit permission grant |
| Storage isolation | Logical (row-level security) minimum; physical/DB-per-tenant optional for high-sensitivity tiers |
| Inter-app data flow tracking | Platform maps a dependency graph: which monitored apps call which other apps/services, and what data categories flow in each direction (`app_a → app_b: {data: [user_email, transaction_id], direction: outbound}`) |
| Cross-tenant leak detection | Alert if data tagged with `tenant_id: X` appears in a trace/log associated with `tenant_id: Y` |

---

## Cross-Cutting: Compliance Mapping Reference

| Framework | Where it applies in this spec |
|---|---|
| NIST AI RMF (Manage function) | §1 redaction event logging, §5 audit trail structure |
| OWASP LLM Top 10 — LLM02 (Sensitive Information Disclosure) | §1, §2 |
| GDPR | §2 regulation mapping, §4 retention |
| PIPEDA (Canada) | §2, §4 — SIN handling specifically |
| HIPAA (if applicable) | §4 retention floor, §3 access logging |

## Suggested MVP Build Order (Hackathon Scope)

1. OTel Collector processor for PII detection/redaction (§1) — highest visual impact
2. Audit event ingestion + severity-based alerting (§5)
3. Tenant-tagged storage schema + RBAC read enforcement (§7, §3)
4. Retention/region compliance dashboard (§2, §4) — can be mocked with sample rule table if time-constrained
